# Hgine
Just an Engine that uses the gdiplus.h. The average FPS are around 65 with 30 sprites. I know it is not the fastest Engine out there but it is really hardcoded and enough for some cool retro games.
Make sure you are using C++ 20. For the best results compile it in x64 release, MSVC and -O2 optimization level!  I am trying to re-create some algorithms from the graphics card and thinking about calling it Hardcore Engine or Hgine:)  

If you want to change something or just found a bug please send me a pullrequest or contact me via discord.

### Note:  
Im 15 years old and still learning C++ so please understand if this is not the best code you have ever seen ;)  
The Engine is still under development and I am only one developer.
