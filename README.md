# CppRawEnginePrototype
Just an Engine that uses the gdiplus.h. The average FPS are around 65 with 30 sprites. I know it is not the fastest Engine out there but it is really hardcoded and enough for some cool retro games.
Make sure you are using C++ 20. For the best results compile it in x64 release! I am trying to re-create some algorithms from the graphics card.
I am thinking about calling it Hardcore Engine :)

Note:
Im 15 years old and still learning C++ so understand if this is not the best code you will ever see ;)
